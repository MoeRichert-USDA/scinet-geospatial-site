## Session Rules

<br>
{:.border-bottom}

CHAT QUESTIONS/COMMENTS TAKE FIRST PRIORITY - Chat your question/comments either to everyone (preferred) or to the chat moderator (Ryan Lucas) privately to have your question/comment read out loud anonamously. We will answer chat questions first and call on people who have written in the chat before we take questions from raised hands.

SHARE YOUR VIDEO WHEN SPEAKING - If your internet plan/connectivity allows, please share your video when speaking.

KEEP YOURSELF ON MUTE - Please mute yourself when not speaking,

## Learning objectives
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

The overall objective of this session is to provide a foundation in parallel processing terminology and HPC-usage basics before applying these concepts in the upcoming tutorials. Please see the links listed in Session 11 for additional parallel processing training opportunities.

* Define an 'embarassingly parallel' problem
* Apply a parallelization approach flowchart to a geospatial problem
* Describe the basic SLURM job submission parameters
* Identify the appropriate Ceres or Atlas partition for a job

## Agenda
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

This session will be a lecture with slides covering the following content:

* Trade-offs in parallel processing: effort, time, communication
* How to approach parallelization: a geospatial example
  * Determine where in your workflow the most time is spent 
  * Flow chart: parallelization approaches 
  * Choosing number of cores  
* SLURM jobs, nodes, and partitions

A recording of this presentation and discussion summary notes will be made available here after the workshop is complete.
