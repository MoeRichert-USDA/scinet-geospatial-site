CHAT QUESTIONS/COMMENTS TAKE FIRST PRIORITY - Chat your question/comments either to everyone (preferred) or to the chat moderator (Ryan Lucas) privately to have your question/comment read out loud anonamously. We will answer chat questions first and call on people who have written in the chat before we take questions from raised hands.

SHARE YOUR VIDEO WHEN SPEAKING - If your internet plan/connectivity allows, please share your video when speaking.

KEEP YOURSELF ON MUTE - Please mute yourself when not speaking,

{:.border-bottom}

This is the first interactive tutorial session. We will be accessing the interactive environments available via [Open OnDemand on Ceres](https://ceres-ood.scinet.usda.gov/). There will be a few introductory slides, a period of screen-sharing to navigate the interface in a browser window, and then example scripts to execute within the environments.  We will cover the following content:

* When to use interactive environments (advantages and limitations) 
* Overview of Open OnDemand layout and Ceres/Atlas specifics
* Launch parameters 
* RStudio – basic tutorial
* Jupyter – basic tutorial
* Desktops w/ QGIS example – more in depth tutorial
