## Session Rules

<br>
{:.border-bottom}

GREEN LIGHT, RED LIGHT - Use the Zoom participant feedback indicators to show us if you are following along successfully as well as when you need help. To access participant feed back, click on the “Participants” icon to open the participants pane/window. Click the green “yes” to indicate that you are following along successfully, click the red “no” to indicate when you need help. Ideally, you will have either the red or green indicator displayed for yourself throughout the entire tutorial. We will pause every so often to work through solutions for participants displaying a red light.

CHAT QUESTIONS/COMMENTS TAKE FIRST PRIORITY - Chat your question/comments either to everyone (preferred) or to the chat moderator (Ryan Lucas) privately to have your question/comment read out loud anonamously. We will answer chat questions first and call on people who have written in the chat before we take questions from raised hands.

SHARE YOUR VIDEO WHEN SPEAKING - If your internet plan/connectivity allows, please share your video when speaking.

KEEP YOURSELF ON MUTE - Please mute yourself when not speaking,
