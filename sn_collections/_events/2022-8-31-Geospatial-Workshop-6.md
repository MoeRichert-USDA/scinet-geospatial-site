    - point: <b>Green Light, Red Light</b> - Use the Zoom participant feedback indicators to show us if you are following along successfully as well as when you need help. To access participant feed back, click on the “Participants” icon to open the participants pane/window. Click the green “yes” to indicate that you are following along successfully, click the red “no” to indicate when you need help. Ideally, you will have either the red or green indicator displayed for yourself throughout the entire tutorial. We will pause every so often to work through solutions for participants displaying a red light.
    - point: <b>Chat questions/comments take first priority</b> - Chat your question/comments either to everyone (preferred) or to the chat moderator (Ryan Lucas) privately to have your question/comment read out loud anonymously. We will answer chat questions first and call on people who have written in the chat before we take questions from raised hands.
    - point: <b>Share your video when speaking</b> - If your internet plan/connectivity allows, please share your video when speaking.
    - point: <b>Keep yourself on mute</b> - Please mute yourself when not speaking.

## Learning objectives
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

This session will include tutorials exploring examples of handling geospatial data, performing geospatial calculations, and applying parallel processing approaches to geosptial processing workflows in R. RStudio via Open OnDemand (see [Session 4](events/2022-8-30-Geospatial-Workshop-4/)) will be used for a portion of the tutorials. 

* Read in and manipulate raster data with the *terra* and *stars* packages
* Read in and manipulate vector data with the *sf* package
* Time chunks of code in your R script
* Identify package functions with parallelization options built-in
* Parallelize R code of many independent geospatial tasks 

## Agenda
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

This session will be an interactive tutorial:

* Geospatial packages
* Parallel processing packages
* Raster tutorial 1
* Raster tutorial 2
* Vector tutorial


A recording of this session and discussion summary notes will be made available here after the workshop is complete. Each tutorial will be converted to [Geospatial Workbook](https://geospatial.101workbook.org) entries.
