## Session Rules

<br>
{:.border-bottom}

CHAT QUESTIONS/COMMENTS TAKE FIRST PRIORITY - Chat your question/comments either to everyone (preferred) or to the chat moderator (Ryan Lucas) privately to have your question/comment read out loud anonamously. We will answer chat questions first and call on people who have written in the chat before we take questions from raised hands.

SHARE YOUR VIDEO WHEN SPEAKING - If your internet plan/connectivity allows, please share your video when speaking.

KEEP YOURSELF ON MUTE - Please mute yourself when not speaking,

## Learning objectives
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

* Read in and manipulate raster data with the *rioxarray* and *xarray* packages
* Read in and manipulate vector data with the *geopandas* package
* Time chunks of code in your python script
* Identify package functions with parallelization options built-in
* Parallelize python code of many independent geospatial tasks 

## Agenda
<br>

Note: this session overlaps with Session 6 which covers the same content but in R instead of python. 

This session will be an interactive tutorial:

* Geospatial packages
* Parallel processing packages
* Raster tutorial 1
* Raster tutorial 2
* Vector tutorial


A recording of this session and discussion summary notes will be made available here after the workshop is complete. Each tutorial will be converted to [Geospatial Workbook](https://geospatial.101workbook.org) entries.
